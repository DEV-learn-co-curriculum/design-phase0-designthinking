# Why is Design Important? #
> ## Design thinking is neither art nor science nor religion. It is the capacity, ultimately, for integrative thinking.

Design thinking is a specific way of approaching user-centered design. It was created by the Stanford D. School (Links to an external site.) and is deeply rooted in empathy and ideation. The concept behind design thinking is simple: If designers understand and take interest in the users they are designing for, their final product will be more innovative, feasible and profitable. Oftentimes, the experiences and products that leave the most lasting impressions are the ones that have been created using design thinking. While design thinking isn't a new concept, you'd be surprised by the number of companies have yet to adopt this practice.

Design thinking is typically broken-down into a five-step iterative process:

**Step 1: Empathize

Designers think carefully about their users to understand who they are. They also get a good grasp on user needs/preferences, the needs of their business and the constraints of the platform they are designing for. 

**Step 2: Define

Designers then define the problem they wish to solve based on user pain point research.

**Step 3: Ideate

In this step, designers come up with creative solutions for the identified problem. 

**Step 4: Prototype

Once they have a finalized solution, designers build out an initial prototype to conceptualize that solution. They then layer in more prototypes to examine features, language and content strategy.

**Step 5: Test

A prototype is a good start, but it needs to hold up to the final step, testing. Designers often create more iterations and refine their product until they achieve their desired results.

### [The Value of Design Thinking in Business](https://www.toptal.com/designers/product-design/design-thinking-business-value)
by [James Pikover](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamespikover) CEO of Voltage (8 min read) Great design is simple, beautiful, and easy to use. It creates a sense of purpose and place. It responds to user needs, and it just works. Aside from these characteristics, how can we know whether a design is “good”? Moreover, how can a business know whether the investment of time and money into a design was worth it? [Read more](https://www.toptal.com/designers/product-design/design-thinking-business-value)

by [Anish Joshi](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/anish-joshi-00634a1) Head of Design and Innovation at [Shell](https://www.shell.com/) (6 min read) Many people in the world and business still see ‘Design’ as that thing which makes things look good, function well, and perhaps have an emotive quality. Recently (although in reality it has been in the public arena for at least a decade now) there has been the emergence of the term, tool, discipline, and mindset, that is ‘Design Thinking’. ‘Created’ and coined by Tim Brown of IDEO, (see my other blog, [‘Dangerous Times in Design’](https://medium.com/@AnishJoshiDesign/dangerous-times-in-design-8651844b8bcd), if you want the definition/ know what it is) it was a nice power move to make; affording designers a whole new playground and application of their skills, and executives a seemingly original angle at which to approach their business problems with. Since then it has slowly gathered favor and momentum, but its use and users have constantly been changing… [Read more](https://uxdesign.cc/design-thinking-isnt-design-it-s-design-thinking-b8a5f96f0294)

by [Adam Leon](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/transmitterstudios) Design & Technology Strategist at [Transmitter Studios](https://cx.transmitterstudios.com/home)(6 min read) Design Thinking. Specific definitions vary and they all include a problem solving process that puts identifying people’s needs first using a variety of tools to achieve results. This is my favourite part. Getting the results. Too often in our industry of software and services we consider that an individual transaction is the end of an association. It shouldn’t be. Digital solutions are not one-off billboards. Iterations, experiments, observations, insights, and action drive real change and create valuable products.
